# SOP GIT task 1

Wield the power of GIT!

Git is a Version Control System (VCS). Version Control Systems is a category of software tools that help to manage changes to code over time. VCS keeps track of every change to the code.

Basically, using a VCS generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover them. Guess that’s motivation enough to learn Git.

Task:

We are faced with the most important question of the century- Which came first: the chicken or the egg? And now, we want your help to resolve this question.

Tell us your answer by following the steps below:

- Fork and Clone the common Github repo (link will be provided by your mentor) to your local system.

- Create a branch named firstname_lastname.

- In this new branch, create a file named log.txt. In this file, you will inventory all the commands you’ve used to complete this task with a short description of each.

- Also create two branches. In one, give a one-word answer to the question posed above. In the other, explain why you decided on that answer.

- Now merge the two branches. Got conflicts? Resolve them manually. Then run Git merge again

- After that, rename your log.txt file in firstname_lastname branch to firstname_lastname.txt.

- When you’re ready, pull the most recent changes from the repo. Then, commit your changes and create a pull request.

- If everything looks good, your mentor will accept your request. Otherwise, convince them your answer is right!

For those without laptops:

- Read up on resources and find out all the commands that will be required to complete the above task.

- Make proper documentation about all necessary commands (with explanations). Also, cover all possible errors and conflicts that may arise.

- Submit it to your mentor. Your mentor may quiz you on your git knowledge, so please refrain from copying.
