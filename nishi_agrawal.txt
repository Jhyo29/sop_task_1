Till Now I have used these commands

git clone https://github.com/nishihere19/sop_task_1

(After forking the repository, cloned it in a new folder)

cd sop_task_1/
(For changing directory to the repo)

git checkout -b nishi_agrawal

(Created a new branch)

touch log.txt

git add log.txt

(Added log.txt to ans)

git commit -am"added log.txt to nishi_agrawal"

(commited changes)

git push origin nishi_agrawal

(Pushed changes using username and password for GitHub)

git branch ans

git branch exp

(Created both branches)

git checkout ans

touch ans.txt

git add ans.txt

git commit -m"added ans.txt to ans"

git push origin ans

git checkout exp

touch ans.txt

git add ans.txt

git commit -m"added ans.txt to exp"

git push origin exp

git checkout ans

git merge exp

(Here I got conflict where I had to manually change the text and save it)

git commit -m"conflict resolved"

git push origin ans

git checkout nishi_agrawal

git merge ans

git push origin nishi_agrawal

mv log.txt nishi_agrawal.txt

(Change the name)

git commit -m"name changed"

git push origin nishi_agrawal

egg

Since evolution is the basis of birth of most of the organisms, I believe it would have happened first in egg then came then chicken.
